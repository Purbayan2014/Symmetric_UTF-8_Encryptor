Symmetric_UTF-8_Encryptor is a one key encryptor and decryptor which means that that the same key has been implemented and used in a such a way that it is being used for both purposes that is encryption and decryption.The key is based on the implementation of UTF-8 encoding.As the name suggests this encryptor/decryptor uses symmetric algorithm(DES).

# Symmetric Key Algorithm

Now what is Symmetric Key encryption ??? So, Symmetric key encryption which is also called symmetric-key cryptography can be defined as the process in which a uniquely assigned secret key is being used for encrypting and decrypting messages so that the unauthorized users cannot meddle with the integrity of the data which is exchanged between the user and the receiver.

# Data Encryption Standard

The Symmetric key algorithm that has been implemented here is the DES encryption which acts a like a single block of cipher which encrypts the data in 64-bit chunks or blocks by using just one key.

# Features

1. Simple and Lightweight
2. Covers 990+ characters including latin alphabets
3. Light version of key(UTF-8) has been used.
4. A simple Character-byte mapping has been used for the key table.

# Download

`git clone https://github.com/Purbayan2014/Symmetric_UTF-8_Encryptor.git`

`cd Symmetric_UTF-8_Encryptor`

# Usage 

There is already a precompilled version but if you want to compile it using yourself then you are most welcome too.
